# Actor Pattern with dapr

dapr is a new programming model that is based on RPC communication between the framework and the user code, namely HTTP. However, it does support developers to write their code using the Actor Pattern. Specifically, dapr allows a contextual Id to be associated with messages. dapr provides:

1) Routing by a contextual Id.
2) Ensuring single-threaded access per contextual Id.
3) Setting and getting state by a contextual Id is serialized.

The combination of above behaviors delivers essential characteristics of an Actor: uniquely identified, single-threaded, with isolated state.

## Authoring an Actor

In dapr, authoring Actor code is no difference with writing any other service code. An Actor in this case is a web server that listens to any number of messages the actor expects to handle.

When a request is routed to a handler of the web server, a contextual Id may present in the request header. dapr guarantees that requests with the same contextual Id are dispatched to the web server sequentially. 

Handler code can set or retrieve state from the dapr sidecar with the contextual Id attached.

## Talking to an Actor

Just like invoking any other dapr instances, you can send a request to an Actor by doing a POST to the sidecar. The **to** address of your message will be in the format of:
```yaml
<Actor name>.<Contextual Id>
```

> dapr uses **virtual actors** pattern. You don't need to explicitly create or destroy Actor instances. 

For example, the following POST request to **/set-temperature** sends a temperature payload to a **theromstat** with id **123**:
```json
{
    "to": [
        "theromstat.123"
    ],
    "data": {
        "temperature": 72
    }
}
```

Your code can access the response from the actor through the HTTP response body.

dapr also allows you to make direct calls to actors. The dapr sidecar provides a special **/actor** route that can be used to route requests to actor instance. For example, to invoke the above actor directly, send a POST request to:
```bash
http://localhost:<sidecarport>/actors/theromstat/123
```

## Key Differences From a Full Actor Framework

dapr programming model is not an Actor programming model. Although it provides certain actor characteristics, dapr differ from common Actor programming model in several ways.

### Single Activation

Many Actor frameworks requires single activation of an actor at any time. dapr doesnâ€™t offer such guarantees. There should be a single activation for the most of time. However, multiple activations may exist during failovers, scaling, and network partitions. dapr will converge back to single activation when such conditions are resolved. 

dapr offers exact-once delivery within a configurable window. dapr delivers requests for the same actor id to the same service instance, while serializing client requests as well as state access of an instance. The combination of these features offers a high-fidelity simulation of the single activation behavior. However, there could be corner cases that cause problems when multiple activations do occur. 

### State Transaction Scope

Some Actor frameworks allow wrapping multiple state operations into an atomic transaction. In dapr, each state operation is a separate transaction. Because dapr doesn't dictate how user code is written, a user may trigger multiple state transactions in the code. If the code crashes between transactions, the state is left at the last committed transaction.
